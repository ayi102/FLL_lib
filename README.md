# FLL_lib Project

## About
The FLL_lib project is a collection of commonly used First Lego League (FLL) scratch programs. They include programs that achieve the following:

- Line Following
- Line Squaring
- PID Control
- Multitask Messaging

 The scratch programs included in this library alone will not achieve any results in competition. You have to study their contents, identify their use for competition, and then use them in your projects. The contents of these programs are NOT a secret and you are encouraged to study, modify, and share them!

 ## Usage
 The best way to utilize and study the scratch programs in this libary is to pull this repository locally to your machine. Next, open them in your FLL scratch IDE of choice, such as:

 - Spike
 - Spike Legacy
 - Mindstorms
